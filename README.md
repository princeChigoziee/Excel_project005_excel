The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- Claim Amount Trends - The insurance policyholder total amount claim is generating $1.88B. indicating a very high demand of insurance claim and this contribute to significantly to high payouts.
- Coverage Zone - Only 5 zone is begin covered with high frequency of 4.
- Frequency Trends - Higher claim frequency observed in Urban zone demonstrating a consistent flow of claims.

- Household income VS Claim Amount - Lower-income groups tend to have smaller claims but files more frequently while Higher-income groups file fever claims but for larger amounts, likely due to luxury vehicle or high-value assets.

---
- Implement predictive modeling to flag potential high-cost claims.
- Promote deductibles to reduce small frequent claims.
